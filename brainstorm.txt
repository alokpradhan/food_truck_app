Food Truck Challenge: Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.

1. Food truck data: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat?

  - location (lat, long)
  - food truck data

2. Google maps to showcase location

  - map lat long
  - show data on map

3. User flow

  - Backend - preseed data in db (httparty)
  - Front-end: Get location from user - convert to lat, long (Geocoder)
  - Font-end: send location to backend (AJAX Post)
  - Backend -
        Geocode address
        locate food trucks within radius
        return result to front end
  - Front-end: in success callback serve map with food truck data
        - table that shows the data
        - place pins on map
